# Storybook CV ZamanNow
### Typescript + React + Storybook + Vite


A software development tool (development tool) used to develop, inspect, and deploy user interface components (UI components) in isolation. Usually, when we develop web-based applications, we build various UI components such as buttons, cards, headers, footers and many more.

Storybook allows us to visualize and interact with these components separately from the main application. In other words, we can create a story for each component and view it in isolation without having to interact with the rest of the application.
